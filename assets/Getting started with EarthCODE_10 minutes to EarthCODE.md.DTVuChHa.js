Your path depends on several factors, including:</p><ul><li>The <strong>type of data</strong> you intend to use.</li><li>Your <strong>workflow preferences</strong> (e.g., no-code platforms vs. Jupyter Notebooks).</li><li>Whether you need <strong>machine learning capabilities</strong>.</li><li>Whether you need <strong>storage capabilities</strong>.</li><li>The level of <strong>collaboration and sharing</strong> required.</li></ul><p>Visit the <a href="./../Technical Documentation/Platforms/"><strong>Platform Selection</strong></a> section to get tailored recommendations on:</p><ul><li>Selecting the best platform for your needs.</li><li>Understanding which tools will streamline your workflow.</li><li>Setting up your environment for collaborative or individual work.</li></ul><p>It’s also a good idea to also familiarize yourself with the <a href="./../Technical Documentation/Open Science Catalog/Contributing to the Open Science Catalog"><strong>Contributing to the OSC section</strong></a> to understand the requirements early on.</p><h3 id="users-exploring-published-research" tabindex="-1">Users Exploring Published Research <a class="header-anchor" href="#users-exploring-published-research" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Users Exploring Published Research&quot;">​</a></h3><p>If you’re here to <strong>explore existing research outputs</strong>, the Open Science Catalog is your primary destination. The catalog allows you to:</p><ul><li><strong>Search for projects</strong> by area, variable, theme, and more.</li><li>Access <strong>datasets, workflows, and documentation</strong> directly from published research.</li><li>View detailed <strong>metadata and provenance information</strong> for each project.</li></ul><p>Go to the <a href="https://opensciencedata.esa.int/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Open Science Catalog</strong></a> to start browsing and discovering data relevant to your interests. Whether you&#39;re looking for specific datasets, workflows, or scientific results, the catalog provides a centralized and well-organized resource.</p><h2 id="choosing-a-platform" tabindex="-1">Choosing a Platform <a class="header-anchor" href="#choosing-a-platform" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Choosing a Platform&quot;">​</a></h2><p>EarthCODE provides you <em>single‑sign‑on</em> access to a growing number of EO platforms that host EO data, development tools and compute. Once you log in with your EarthCODE account, you carry the same identity across the <strong>EarthCODE Portal</strong>, the <strong>EarthCODE Forum</strong>, each <strong>integrated platform</strong>, and the <strong>Open Science Catalog</strong>.</p><p>For all of the EarthCODE integrated platforms, you can apply for Network‑of‑Resources (NoR) sponsorship to cover compute costs. Every platform comes with FAIR tooling that lets you publish results to the Open Science Catalog in an automated manner. Additionally, some platforms support creating and executing several types of workflows, which means that if you develop a workflow on them, it will be cross-compatible with other platforms supporting the same type of workflow.</p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt="EarthCODE Platform"></p><hr><p>Platforms differ in four areas: the data they give you access to (and the way you access the data), the way you develop workflows on them, specialized hardware and infrastructure they offer, and the visualisation tools they offer.</p><hr><h3 id="data-access" tabindex="-1">Data Access <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-access" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Data Access&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Each platform provides a variety of EO data stored on the cloud and expose access in different ways. For example you can access the full Sentinel, Landsat, and MODIS archives via the Sentinel Hub API on the Euro Data Cube platform. By moving your compute to data, you eliminate the need to download and handle large files and benefit from distributed, cloud-optimized services to scale at the local, regional and global level of analysis. Moreover, by referencing inputs for your workflows through links to a platform, you ensure reusability and reproducibility of your data and workflows.</p><p><a href="https://s2maps.eu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="'+s+'" alt="Sentinel Data https://eox.at/2024/08/sentinel-2-cloudless-2023/"></a><em>Sentinel Data at Scale - The Mediterranean - <a href="https://s2maps.eu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sentinel-2 cloudless 2023</a></em></p><hr><h3 id="workflow-development" tabindex="-1">Workflow Development <a class="header-anchor" href="#workflow-development" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Workflow Development&quot;">​</a></h3><p>EarthCODE platforms differ in interface and how you build and run workflows: some offer visual process designers, others provide Jupyter Notebooks with extensions, and several combine both. For example OpenEO provides an API, a set of client libraries, supporting modern programming languages such as Python, and a graphical interface. Many platforms also ship pre‑configured machine‑learning environments and ready‑made domain workflows. Pick the platform whose tooling matches the tools you already use and project goals; cloud execution keeps everything reproducible and scalable without local setup hassles. By using platforms to develop code you can directly publish end-to-end FAIR workflows that enable users to reproduce and reuse result datasets and code.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="OpenEO Web Editor"><em>OpenEO Web Editor GUI</em></p><hr><h3 id="specialized-hardware-and-tools" tabindex="-1">Specialized Hardware and Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#specialized-hardware-and-tools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Specialized Hardware and Tools&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Platforms vary in the compute they expose: some offer standard CPU and some offer tools for managing models (e.g. MLFlow) others provide options for fast storage devices or pre‑installed ML frameworks. DeepESDL, for example, supplies ready‑made GPU environments with PyTorch, TensorFlow and EO ML- specific libraries such as ml4xcube. Choosing a platform with the right hardware stack and specialised tools allows you to scale, worry less about infrastructure and spend more time on doing science.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="mlxcube"><em>DeepESDL ml4xcube <a href="https://github.com/deepesdl/ML-Toolkits/blob/master/Examples/use_case_lst_at_pytorch_mlflow.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Air Temperature Prediction Plot</a></em></p><hr><h3 id="vizualization-tools" tabindex="-1">Vizualization tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#vizualization-tools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Vizualization tools&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Platforms differ in how they let you visualize published results from others and present your own results, some embed interactive map widgets, time‑series explorers or dashboard builders, some allow you to easily combine multiple data cubes. DeepESDL, for instance, includes the xcube viewer, a browser‑based component for slicing and animating data cubes. Robust in‑platform visualisation can streamline exploratory analysis and make it easier to share insights, so factor these capabilities into your platform choice.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="DeepESDL"><em>DeepESDL <a href="https://viewer.earthsystemdatalab.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Xcube Viewer</a></em></p><p>Visit the <a href="./../Technical Documentation/Platforms/">Working with Platforms</a> page to explore EarthCODE platform and for help to choose the platform that best suits your research objectives.</p><h2 id="publishing-to-the-open-science-catalog" tabindex="-1">Publishing to the Open Science Catalog <a class="header-anchor" href="#publishing-to-the-open-science-catalog" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Publishing to the Open Science Catalog&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To publish your scientific results to the Open Science Catalog, you must:</p><ol><li>Host your <strong>datasets</strong>, <strong>code</strong> and <strong>documentation</strong> online.</li></ol><details class="details custom-block"><summary>Proprietary data</summary><p>Sometimes parts of the data and workflows are protected or private.
