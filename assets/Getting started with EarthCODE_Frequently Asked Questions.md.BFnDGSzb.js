The FAIR principles do <strong>not</strong> require assets to be fully open, so you may publish pre-trained models or anonymized datasets. Wherever possible, include a small sample dataset to help others reproduce and validate your workflow.</p></details><details><summary><strong>Can I add proprietary datasets to the OSC ?</strong></summary><p>Yes, provided the correct licensing information is specified.</p></details><details><summary><strong>I am not an ESA funded project. Can I publish to the OSC?</strong></summary><p>Currently, this is decided on a case by case basis.

However, new products can be added on some occasions. Contact the EarthCODE team with details about your usecase to get more specific information.</p></details><details><summary><strong>I am not an ESA funded project. Can I upload my data to the ESA PRR?</strong></summary><p>The PRR primarily serves ESA-related projects, however other projects such as those from the ESA member state space agencies can also apply.

You can still process data in GEE and then manually publish the resulting datasets and workflows to EarthCODE. We have logged the community‚Äôs interest in a future GEE integration.</p></details><details><summary><strong>Can I transfer unused NoR credits between platforms?</strong></summary><p>Not yet.

Once your data and workflows are FAIR, the same metadata can be exposed to other registries‚Äîsuch as the GEO Knowledge Hub‚Äîwithout duplicating effort.</p></details><details><summary><strong>How do I integrate a platform with EarthCODE?</strong></summary><p>ESA issues ‚ÄúBest‚ÄëPractice‚Äù procurement tenders periodically.
