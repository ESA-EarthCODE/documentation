This includes the following capabilities:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Integrated Workflow Development Tools</strong> Platforms must offer environments for creating and editing scientific workflows, such as JupyterLab notebooks, IDEs, or dedicated graphical user interfaces (GUIs). These tools should allow researchers to seamlessly write code, manage software dependencies, and interact with data, ultimately producing formal &quot;Experiment&quot; definitions that link workflows to their specific inputs and configurations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Source Code Management and Automation</strong> To ensure versioning and reproducibility, platforms must integrate with source code management systems like Git. They should provide Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the process of:</p><ul><li><strong>Building:</strong> Packaging the workflow and its software environment into a standardized container image (e.g., Docker).</li><li><strong>Testing:</strong> Running automated tests to verify the correctness of the code.</li><li><strong>Deploying:</strong> Making the versioned, containerized workflow ready for execution on FAIR Infrastructure Platforms.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Workflow Validation</strong> Before execution, platforms must perform validation checks to prevent runtime errors and ensure interoperability. This includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Syntax and Semantic Validation:</strong> Verifying that the workflow definition is valid according to its specified standard (e.g., an openEO Process Graph).</li><li><strong>Compatibility Checks:</strong> Ensuring the workflow is compatible with the target FAIR Infrastructure Platform where it is intended to be run.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Reproducibility Checks</strong> To guarantee that experiments can be reproduced, platforms must validate the inputs and configuration before a workflow is published or executed. This involves confirming that all input data references are valid and accessible, and that all configuration parameters are complete and correct for the specified workflow.</p></li><li><p><strong>Monitoring and Observability</strong> Researchers need clear feedback during the development process. Platforms should provide tools for real-time logging, monitoring the status of builds and tests, and observing the behavior of workflows during development runs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Documentation and Support</strong> Platform providers must supply comprehensive documentation covering both user-facing guides and technical integration details. This includes operational guides for scientists and clearly defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for the services provided.</p></li></ul>',4)]))}const m=t(n,[["render",a]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
