It is where metadata describing published data products, experiments, and workflows is made publicly available and reusable. Integrated platforms also may provide re-usable workflow services that support FAIR an Open Science on the catalog. Researchers use EarthCODE platforms to generate and submit metadata, which—after validation and a manual review—is published to the Open Science Catalog.</p><p>Metadata describing datasets (Products) is published using the <strong>SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)</strong> specification. Workflows and experiments are described using the <strong>OGC API - Records</strong> standard. These two metadata models are connected by references. The Open Science Catalog is also integrated with EarthCODE&#39;s computing infrastructure. Users with appropriate access—such as NoR-sponsored compute—can reproduce experiments directly from the catalog. This means running the same workflow with the same input and configuration on a compatible platform, enabling reproducible results.</p><p>The catalog acts as both a registry of published research artifacts and an operational gateway for executing FAIR experiments across federated EO platforms</p><p><strong>Platform Integration</strong> The Open Science Catalogue is accessible through open standard interfaces through which the Portal and Platforms integrate for discovery (mainly STAC API) and publishing - note that the integration for publishing currently happens directly via Github. Platforms can make requests to obtain items using their unique Experiment Id or unique Product Id.</p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt="Open Science Interfaces"><em>Open Science Catalog Interfaces</em></p><h3 id="publishing-experiments-data-and-workflows" tabindex="-1">Publishing Experiments Data and Workflows <a class="header-anchor" href="#publishing-experiments-data-and-workflows" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Publishing Experiments Data and Workflows&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Once a research activity is complete, the results can be published to the EarthCODE ecosystem, making them findable, reproducible, and reusable by the broader scientific community. Integrated platforms automate this process by generating the appropriate metadata and pushing it to the EarthCODE Open Science Catalog github repository.

Published Products are associated to Projects and additional information is provided by tags. Themes and Variables are used as tags to facilitate Products discovery.
