By standardizing these definitions, we enable the following architecture:</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="alt text"></p><p>FAIR Open Science Platforms are responsible for creating workflow definitions. Each workflow definition is dependent upon data definitions that describe the input data it consumes and the data¬†(products) it produces as well as configurations to be passed as an environment for the workflow. All of this should be generated automatically by the platforms to make it easy for the users to publish to the Open Science Catalog.</p><p>Infrastructure Platforms ingest workflow definitions and execute them close to the required input data. Access to data used by a workflow is typically provided on the same platform, reducing transfer overhead and the risk of failure. In some cases, data hosted on Infrastructure Platforms can be shared back to FAIR Open Science Platforms‚Äîfor example, to support a local Python script with test data before conversion into a full workflow.</p><p>Input metadata describes the input data for a workflow and guides both execution and user interfaces. FAIR Open Science Platforms and Infrastructure Platforms may specialise in one or more types of workflows and in one or more types of Data. Consistent metadata definitions also facilitate the creation of GUIs and tools to help execute and manage workflows. Once validated, workflow definitions, data definitions and related artifacts can be published to the Open Science Catalogue and exploited by the Community Platform.</p>',28)]))}const g=t(s,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
