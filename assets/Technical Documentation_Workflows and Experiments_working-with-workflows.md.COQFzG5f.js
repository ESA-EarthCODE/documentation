Like products, workflows are discoverable items (<a href="https://opensciencedata.esa.int/workflows/catalog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">view in OSC</a>) with metadata linking them to projects, themes, and experiments. Understanding and reusing these workflows is key to reproducible science in EarthCODE; this page explains what they are and how to find them.</p><h2 id="what-are-workflows-and-experiments-in-earthcode" tabindex="-1">What are Workflows and Experiments in EarthCODE? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-workflows-and-experiments-in-earthcode" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What are Workflows and Experiments in EarthCODE?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In EarthCODE, a published data <strong>Product</strong> is the result of a defined scientific process, which is captured as an <strong>Experiment</strong>. An Experiment record links a specific output product back to the exact <strong>Workflow</strong> used to create it, making the entire research process transparent and reproducible.</p><p>A <strong>workflow</strong> defines the set of processing steps used in an experiment. It is not just source code—it is something that can be formally executed within a platform using a defined interface. Workflows may take different forms, including:</p><ul><li>openEO Process Graphs</li><li>OGC API Processes (e.g. CWL, Application Package)</li><li>MLflow models</li><li>Jupyter Notebooks</li></ul><p>This ensures workflows can be cross-executable between platforms, promoting interoperability and reuse. The OSC provides the central interface to discover and access these interconnected components, enabling FAIR science.</p><h2 id="discovering-workflows-in-the-osc" tabindex="-1">Discovering Workflows in the OSC <a class="header-anchor" href="#discovering-workflows-in-the-osc" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Discovering Workflows in the OSC&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Workflows are discoverable resources within the Open Science Catalog, just like Data Products. You can explore and discover them the same way as products, described in the <a href="/documentation/Technical Documentation/Open Science Catalog/Discovering Resources">OSC guide</a>.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="workflows-gif"></p><p>You can browse the dedicated <a href="https://opensciencedata.esa.int/workflows/catalog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Workflows section</a> of the OSC. Similar to products, workflows are linked to relevant <a href="https://opensciencedata.esa.int/themes/catalog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Themes</strong></a>, <a href="https://opensciencedata.esa.int/projects/catalog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Projects</strong></a>, <a href="https://opensciencedata.esa.int/variables/catalog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Variables</strong></a>, and <a href="https://opensciencedata.esa.int/eo-missions/catalog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>EO-Missions</strong></a>.</p><h2 id="accessing-source-code" tabindex="-1">Accessing Source Code <a class="header-anchor" href="#accessing-source-code" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Accessing Source Code&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The source code that supports a workflow may be referenced, but the workflow itself must be described in a way that allows it to be executed by integrated EarthCODE platforms. This distinction enables reproducibility and compatibility across platforms. Platforms handle these definitions.</p><p>Workflows are typically stored in the <strong>EarthCODE GitHub organization</strong>, and referenced in the Open Science Catalog as part of the workflow metadata.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="github access"></p><h2 id="accessing-workflows-on-platforms" tabindex="-1">Accessing Workflows on Platforms <a class="header-anchor" href="#accessing-workflows-on-platforms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Accessing Workflows on Platforms&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Discovering a workflow in the Open Science Catalog is the first step; the next is accessing it for reuse or execution. The workflow&#39;s metadata record in the OSC often provides direct links to facilitate this.</p><p>Workflow records include links that allow you to directly open the workflow within an integrated EarthCODE platform. For example, a Jupyter Notebook workflow might have a link to open it directly in a platform like DeepESDL or EDC EOxHub Workspaces, provided you have an account (via EarthCODE SSO). Similarly, an openEO Process Graph might be directly usable via the openEO web editor or client libraries connected to the CDSE backend.</p><p>Executing these workflows, especially those designed for large-scale data processing, typically requires computational resources. You can make a request to ESA to sponsor you to use these resources via the NoR.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="accessing workflows on Platforms"></p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">NoR Sponsorship</p><p>If you need compute resources to run a workflow you discovered, you may be eligible for sponsorship through the <strong>ESA Network of Resources (NoR)</strong>.

These are often complex pipelines designed for specific platforms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Showcase / Tutorial Workflow:</strong> This is a simpler workflow designed to demonstrate how users can <strong>access, open, and perform basic analysis</strong> on your published Data Product. Its goal is reusability and accessibility, acting as live documentation and a starting point for others wanting to use your data (often provided as a Jupyter Notebook).</p></li></ol><p>While publishing the full production workflow is ideal for reproducibility, <strong>you are highly encouraged to provide at least a showcase/tutorial workflow</strong> for every Data Product to maximize its usability and impact.</p><h2 id="terms-and-taxonomy" tabindex="-1">Terms and Taxonomy <a class="header-anchor" href="#terms-and-taxonomy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Terms and Taxonomy&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Workflows and Experiments in the OSC use the same core terms as Products, as described in the <a href="/documentation/Technical Documentation/Open Science Catalog/Discovering Resources">Discovering Data guide</a>.
