Our goal is to offer a comprehensive learning experience that supports researchers at every stage of their journey—whether you’re just beginning or aiming to master advanced features.</p><h2 id="earthcode-training-materials" tabindex="-1">EarthCODE Training Materials <a class="header-anchor" href="#earthcode-training-materials" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;EarthCODE Training Materials&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We offer a curated collection of training materials developed and maintained by EarthCODE, designed to guide you through using our platform effectively. These materials are hosted on our <strong>EarthCODE Training Portal</strong>, available via GitHub. They include:</p><ul><li><strong>Step-by-step tutorials</strong>: These cover everything from setting up your environment to working with Earth observation data, creating workflows, and publishing research. These tutorials are ideal for beginners and provide foundational knowledge.</li><li><strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong>: Interactive, hands-on notebooks that enable you to apply what you&#39;ve learned in real-time. These include exercises on accessing and analyzing Earth observation data and building custom workflows.</li><li><strong>Case studies and practical examples</strong>: Real-world examples that show how EarthCODE can be used to solve specific scientific challenges. These case studies cover topics like climate science, geospatial analysis, and data-driven decision-making.</li></ul><p>In addition to these, we also offer <strong>NoR Training</strong>, a specialized resource designed to help you leverage the <strong>Network of Resources (NoR)</strong> within EarthCODE. The NoR is a key part of our collaborative research infrastructure, enabling users to access, manage, and share datasets, workflows, and results across different platforms. Through <strong>NoR Training</strong>, you will learn how to:</p><ul><li>Efficiently manage and access resources within EarthCODE&#39;s ecosystem.</li><li>Integrate external resources and data sources into your workflows.</li><li>Connect with other researchers and collaborate effectively using EarthCODE’s tools.</li></ul><p>NoR Training is a critical part of understanding how to maximize EarthCODE&#39;s potential for collaborative and scalable research. You can find <strong>NoR Training materials</strong> in the <strong>EarthCODE Training Portal</strong>, where we provide detailed guides and practical examples on how to use the NoR network.</p><h2 id="recommended-external-resources" tabindex="-1">Recommended External Resources <a class="header-anchor" href="#recommended-external-resources" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Recommended External Resources&quot;">​</a></h2><p>While EarthCODE offers comprehensive training specific to our platform, we also acknowledge the importance of supplementary materials. Several excellent external resources cover topics like data cubes, Earth observation, and open science, which complement the training provided by EarthCODE. While not directly maintained by EarthCODE, these resources are recommended for users seeking to expand their knowledge.</p><p>Some of the key external resources include:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://eo-college.org/courses/cubes-and-clouds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cubes &amp; Clouds</a></strong>: A course focused on data cubes, cloud computing, and open science in Earth observation. This aligns well with EarthCODE’s mission to promote open access to scientific data.</li><li><strong>External Platforms and Tools</strong>: We also highlight other platforms like the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) and Euro Data Cube (EDC), which offer additional learning materials that integrate with EarthCODE.</li></ul><h2 id="where-to-find-the-materials" tabindex="-1">Where to Find the Materials <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-to-find-the-materials" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Where to Find the Materials&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>EarthCODE Training Materials</strong>: All of the EarthCODE-developed training materials, including NoR Training, are available on our <strong>GitHub repository</strong>. You can explore tutorials, case studies, Jupyter Notebooks, and NoR Training materials here: <a href="#">EarthCODE Training Portal</a>.</li><li><strong>External Training Resources</strong>: Links to recommended external training materials like &quot;Cubes &amp; Clouds&quot; and others can be found in the <strong>Training Materials Section</strong> of the EarthCODE documentation under &quot;Recommended External Resources.&quot;</li></ul><p>By combining EarthCODE’s training materials with these trusted external resources, you will be equipped to tackle complex research tasks, collaborate with others, and contribute to impactful scientific work. Whether you’re learning the basics or diving into advanced workflows, these materials are designed to provide flexible, comprehensive support for your learning journey.</p><h2 id="upcoming-training-events-and-recordings-of-past-sessions" tabindex="-1">Upcoming Training Events and Recordings of Past Sessions <a class="header-anchor" href="#upcoming-training-events-and-recordings-of-past-sessions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Upcoming Training Events and Recordings of Past Sessions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Stay updated on upcoming training events, webinars, and workshops hosted by EarthCODE.
