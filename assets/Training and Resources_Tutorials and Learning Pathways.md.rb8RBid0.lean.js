Once you understand your role and what EarthCODE can offer, you can explore the relevant guide or go directly to the <a href="https://esa-earthcode.github.io/tutorials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Examples Bank</a>. Finding an example that closely matches your data, workflow, or problem is often the best starting point, as most examples are drawn from real-world projects.</p><p>At any point during this process, you can engage in the forum and ask for help. If you are using a platform, you can also contact them directly.</p><h2 id="next-steps" tabindex="-1">Next Steps <a class="header-anchor" href="#next-steps" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Next Steps&quot;">​</a></h2><p>After learning the basics, you can explore EarthCODE in greater depth. This includes reviewing the <a href="./../Community and Best Practices/">Best Practices guide</a> and gaining a thorough understanding of the FAIR principles. Based on what you learn from the guide and your use case, you may want to update your data or workflows to align more closely to FAIR principles.</p><p>At this stage, you can also explore other existing projects to learn from their approaches. In addition, you can examine more advanced examples to discover how others are applying EarthCODE capabilities.</p><p>Furthermore, you can explore the following advanced materials:</p><h2 id="recommended-materials-and-training" tabindex="-1">Recommended Materials and Training <a class="header-anchor" href="#recommended-materials-and-training" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Recommended Materials and Training&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="courses" tabindex="-1">Courses <a class="header-anchor" href="#courses" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Courses&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://eo-college.org/courses/cubes-and-clouds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cubes &amp; Clouds</a></strong>: A course focused on data cubes, cloud computing, and open science in Earth observation.
