NoR aims to enhance collaboration and streamline the research process, making it easier for users to leverage Earth observation data and other resources for their projects.</p><p>NoR collaborates with a wide range of service providers, including data hubs, cloud computing platforms, and analytical services. If you&#39;re working on an Earth observation project, NoR sponsorship can significantly reduce operational costs and enhance your access to cutting-edge resources. For more information, visit: <a href="https://nor-discover.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://nor-discover.org/</a>.</p><p>Access to the platforms provided by NoR is managed through this initiative. To apply for NoR sponsorship and gain access to the full range of resources, please refer to the NoR Sponsorship Application section for detailed instructions on how to apply.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>EarthCODE will manage the NoR subscription process moving forward. However, until the integration with NoR is fully finalized, users will need to request their own subscription directly. We will notify you once this process is automated and fully integrated into EarthCODE.</p></div><p>A key feature of NoR is that all participating platforms offer on-demand training to users. Sponsored by NoR, these training sessions provide high-quality educational materials to help researchers fully utilize the available resources. Whether you&#39;re learning to work with Earth observation data or developing complex workflows, NoR’s training is an invaluable asset for enhancing your research skills.</p><p>For more details on available training materials, please visit the <a href="./">Tutorials and Resources section</a>.</p><p>Through NoR, ESA also offers sponsorship opportunities to help cover the costs of data access, storage, and processing on participating platforms, allowing researchers to focus on their projects without financial constraints.</p><h3 id="who-can-apply" tabindex="-1"><strong>Who Can Apply?</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#who-can-apply" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Who Can Apply?**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>NoR sponsorship is available for:</p><ul><li>Researchers and scientists conducting projects with a strong focus on <strong>Earth observation data</strong>.</li><li>Educational initiatives and institutions integrating Earth observation data into their curriculum.</li><li>Projects aligning with ESA’s objectives, particularly those promoting <strong>sustainable development</strong>, <strong>innovation</strong>, or <strong>technological advancement</strong>.</li></ul><p>Applications are assessed based on scientific merit, societal impact, and the alignment with ESA’s mission.</p><h3 id="how-to-apply-for-nor-sponsorship" tabindex="-1"><strong>How to Apply for NoR Sponsorship</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-apply-for-nor-sponsorship" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**How to Apply for NoR Sponsorship**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Applying for NoR sponsorship is straightforward.
