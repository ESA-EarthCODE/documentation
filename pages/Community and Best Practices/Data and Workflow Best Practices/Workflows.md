## Best Practices for high-quality Code, Data and Workflows

Maintaining high-quality code and data throughout your project ensures that your outputs are reusable, trustworthy, and easier to publish. Below are tips and recommended practices to support quality assurance and reproducibility:

- Code Quality
     - Use Version Control: Track your development using Git and a shared repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab).
     - Automate Testing: Implement unit tests and integration tests using tools like pytest, unittest, or CI/CD workflows.
     - Follow Coding Standards: Adopt a consistent style (e.g., PEP8 for Python) and use linters (e.g., flake8, black) to maintain code clarity.
     - Write Documentation: Provide clear usage instructions and inline comments. Consider using Jupyter Notebooks or Markdown README files to explain workflows.
- Data Quality
     - Validate Your Data: Apply automated checks for data formats, missing values, and schema consistency.
     - Document Your Data: Create or maintain metadata alongside your datasets, including descriptions of variables, units, and collection methods.
     - Use Standard Formats: Choose interoperable, machine-readable formats (e.g., NetCDF, GeoTIFF, Zarr) and community-agreed standards (such as CF-Conventions).
     - Track Data Changes: when needed, version datasets as they evolve and log processing steps to support reproducibility.
- Integration with EarthCODE
     - Use EarthCODE-Compatible Tools: When possible, rely on tools and environments that are natively supported within EarthCODE platforms.
     - Test Workflows in EarthCODE Early: Validate your workflows in the target platform before final publication to avoid integration issues.
     - Publish Intermediate Outputs: Store and document intermediate results to help others understand and reuse your work incrementally.
     - Regularly revisiting these practices during the project lifecycle will reduce last-minute issues and make your results easier to share and build upon.
