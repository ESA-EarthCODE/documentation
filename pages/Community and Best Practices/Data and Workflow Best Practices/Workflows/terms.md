# Key Terms

## Acronyms, Abbreviations, and Terms

| **Term** | **Meaning** |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Logging** | Automatically recording configuration settings, inputs, and outputs when a workflow runs. Logging helps ensure that analyses can be **reproduced** and errors traced efficiently. |
| **Maintainability** | The ease with which code can be read, understood, and updated by others. Well-documented, modular workflows are more maintainable and easier to build upon. |
| **Modularity** | Writing code in **reusable, independent components** (modules or functions). This makes workflows easier to test, debug, and share between projects. |
| **Notebooks** | Interactive documents combining code, text, and results (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks). Ideal for exploration and training, but final reproducible workflows should also be submitted as **scripts or packaged code** to ensure consistent execution. |
| **Packages** | Reusable code collections distributed with documentation (e.g., Python packages or R libraries). Packages promote consistency, reduce duplication, and simplify sharing code used in workflows. |
| **Parameters and Arguments** | Configurable inputs that allow workflows to be flexible and reusable. Parameters define expected inputs; arguments are the specific values passed when running the workflow. |
| **Pipeline** | A structured sequence of processing steps, where outputs from one stage feed into the next. Workflows should define clear **input, processing, and output stages** to ensure reproducibility. |
| **Readability** | The clarity of your code â€” making it understandable for collaborators and reviewers. Readable code is **consistent, well-documented, and logically structured**. |
| **Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP)** | Workflows built using open tools, good coding practices, and automation, ensuring that results can be independently reproduced. RAPs embody the FAIR and Open Science principles promoted by EarthCODE. |
| **Scripts** | A code file that performs specific analysis steps or orchestrates an entire workflow. All scripts should run **without manual intervention** to support reproducibility. |
| **Version Control** | Tracking and managing changes in your code over time. Tools like **Git**, combined with platforms such as **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or **BitBucket**, allow collaborative development and open publication of your workflows. |
| **Virtual Environments** | Isolated software setups containing the specific versions of dependencies required by a workflow. They help ensure that analyses remain reproducible across systems and time. |
