# Best practices

The EarthCODE ecosystem is designed to support FAIR and Open Science by default—but achieving that in practice depends on how you prepare and publish and manage your code, data, and workflows. This section introduces how EarthCODE implements FAIR principles and resources to help you follow best practices that make your research more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.

These guides show you how to structure your work in a way that's aligned with EarthCODE requirements and community standards. You’ll find practical advice on how to improve metadata, adopt version control, structure your documentation, and ensure that your outputs are truly FAIR.

Explore the following guides:

- [Code, Data and Workflow Quality](./Code%20Data%20and%20Workflow%20Quality.md): A practical walkthrough for preparing your research artefacts for publication and reuse.
- [FAIR and Open Science](./FAIR%20and%20Open%20Science.md): An in-depth look at how to make your published results FAIR and how EarthCODE supports you in that journey.
