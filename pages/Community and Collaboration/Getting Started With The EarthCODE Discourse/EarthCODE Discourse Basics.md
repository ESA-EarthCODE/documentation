# EarthCODE Discourse Basics

Get started with the EarthCODE Discourse by reading this guide or directly jump in to our [getting started post on Discourse](https://discourse-earthcode.eox.at/t/welcome-to-earthcode-community/5)

## Basic Terms Used by Discourse

Here are some key terms you should be familiar with while using Discourse:

- **Topic**: A series of messages grouped together in a meaningful conversation with a title, listed in a category, beginning with an Original Post, and including all replies in chronological order. This is similar to what other platforms might call a "thread."
- **Post**: An individual message within a topic. Each post can be authored by different users, moved to another topic, or become the start of a new topic.
- **Original Post (OP)**: The first post in any topic. It determines the focus of the topic and is associated with the title and tags.
- **Category**: The primary way of organizing topics. Each topic resides in one category, which can have its own permissions and notification settings. Categories are similar to forums on other sites.
- **Tag**: A marker used to describe a topic. Each topic can have multiple tags and users can create new ones.
- **User**: All site activities, like creating posts and recording actions, are centered around registered users. Discourse sites may be private or public, but registration is required for participation.

# EarthCODE Discourse Structure

EarthCODE Discourse is organized into categories designed to keep discussions focused and easy to navigate. Each category serves a specific purpose, so it’s important to post your content where it fits best. This helps keep the forum tidy and ensures that others can easily find relevant discussions. 

Before diving in, familiarize yourself with the forum’s [Code of Conduct](https://discourse-earthcode.eox.at/faq). This outlines the expectations for respectful and constructive interactions within the community. 

## EarthCODE Login
First [sign up to the EarthCODE Portal](../../Getting%20started%20with%20EarthCODE/Accessing%20EarthCODE.md) if you haven't done so already. After you have created an account with EarthCODE's Portal you will be able to login to Discourse through EarthCODE's **Single Sign-On (SSO)**, using the same credentials. This is currently managed via your **GitHub account**.

If you are not automatically logged in to Discourse, just click the login button and you’ll be automatically redirected to the central EarthCODE login page. There, you can sign in using your GitHub credentials. Once authenticated, you’ll be returned to the forum and logged in automatically.

  ![blue_circle](/img/discourse/blue_circle.png)

## See Who's Participating

On the homepage, you can see avatars of:
![participants](/img/discourse/participants.png)

- The user who started the topic
- The most active participants
- The user who created the most recent post
- If the original poster is also the most recent poster, the first photo has a blue border or halo

Indicators at the bottom of the OP show who created the post, the count of replies, and views, and the avatars of the most frequent participants:

## Related Topics

Posts can be moved to more appropriate topics, or two related topics can be merged. A link will appear allowing readers to jump to the new location. Related topics are listed at the end of the OP:
