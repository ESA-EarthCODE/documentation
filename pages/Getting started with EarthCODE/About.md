# About EarthCODE

<!-- To better understand what EarthCODE is and what it aims to achieve, it's helpful to look at the vision of the project, how it started—and how it has evolved. -->

Modern Earth system science faces complex challenges that demand collaborative, transparent, and reproducible approaches. At the heart of this transformation is the convergence of **FAIR principles** (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability), **Open Science**, and Open Innovation—all of which create unprecedented opportunities for scalable, cross-sector research and decision-making.

To effectively address pressing societal challenges, researchers must be able to work across the entire science lifecycle. This requires modern, powerful, and interoperable infrastructure that can support diverse Earth Observation (EO) data types, facilitate data-intensive workflows, and enable trusted knowledge generation. This infrastructure for open science empower scientists to (1) Access and process satellite and in-situ data in collaborative cloud environments, (2) Develop and publish reusable code and workflows, (3) Validate outputs and share reproducible results, and (4) Collaborate across institutional, disciplinary, and national boundaries.

The **Open Science and Innovation Vision** outlined in ESA’s Earth Observation Science Strategy (2024) defines eight foundational pillars to achieve this:  
1) open research data,  
2) open-source scientific code,  
3) open access to scientific publications with data and code,  
4) standards-based discovery of scientific experiments,  
5) reproducible workflows across platforms,  
6) accessible education and training on open science,  
7) collaborative community practices, and  
8) EO business models based on open technologies.

ESA's strategic objective is to **foster the development of a culture and practice of openness in EO science, applications and industry, and of a sustainable open innovation ecosystem.**

EarthCODE ([earthcode.esa.int](https://earthcode.esa.int)) is ESA’s strategic initiative to bring this vision to life. Originally starting as a simple repository for datasets from ESA-funded projects, it has since grown into a comprehensive environment that supports the full open science lifecycle—from data and workflow development to publication and community engagement.

:::tip What is Open Science? Open Science is just science done right.
Open Science is a movement to make the entire research process more accessible and reproducible, including input data, analysis methods, results, and the dissemination and reception of those results.

<!-- what is open science

Open science principles are increasingly being embraced in Earth sciences to promote transparency, collaboration, and accessibility of research. Commonly, these principles are being applied by promoting open access publications, preprints and an open review process, sharing data and methodologies openly for verification, reproducibility and reuse, embracing open-source principles in software development to allow others to inspect, modify, and contribute to the code, encouraging collaboration among researchers through various platforms like GitHub, GitLab and other collaborative tools, sharing educational resources openly to allow for a global audience, and by promoting citizen science. 

  

Open Science is also creating global impact, as shown by the increasing number of resources on open science, and by the dedicated programmes and initiatives to promote open science adoption in the community (AGU, 2024), (Murphy, 2021), (P. J. Zellner et al., 2024). Policies and recommendations from international bodies (EU, 2020), (European Commission, 2021), (UNESCO, 2022), further aim to make the scientific process more transparent, accessible, and inclusive. 

  

This global trend comes in the age of the cloud revolution, making advanced and resource hungry processing increasingly accessible, as researchers can discover, access and process huge amounts of Earth data from EO platforms, couple their analyses with models, and run complex workflows on powerful infrastructures that can scale and are accessed on demand, from the convenience of their desk. 

  

Together, Open Science and EO platforms create huge opportunities for Earth System science. Still, there is significant complexity to consider. One good example of where common principles promoted by open science are insufficient for a cloud computing scenario is making available the dataset package for a publication, in which researchers should aim to make their data accessible for download in “1-click”. Consider the case of high-resolution global datasets produced by workflows executed on platforms that accesses cloud-optimized Earth Observation and other Earth data. Not only it is cost and resource ineffective to deliver this dataset for download, but it also hinders reproducibility and use, as its sole delivery, even with the accompanying code, is insufficient without the access to the infrastructure. Sustainable Open Science must account for the new complexities and requirements of the cloud-computing research era.
