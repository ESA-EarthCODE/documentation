# Accessing EarthCODE

This subsection explains how to access the core EarthCODE features:

1. The integrated platforms
2. The ESA Project Results Repository
3. The Open Science Catalog
4. The EarthCODE Forum
5. The EarthCODE workspace

The access requirements and options depend on each feature and the type of action you wish to perform. Additionally, some access options can be managed indirectly through the [EarthCODE portal](https://earthcode.esa.int).


## Open access functions

Browsing and exploring the Open Science Catalog, the ESA Project Results Repository (ESA PRR), and the EarthCODE Forum are freely accessible to anyone via their respective websites. Furthermore, no login is required for downloading data from the Open Science Catalog or the ESA PRR.

For detailed instructions, see the guides and example pages for each:
- [Open Science catalog (OSC)](../Technical%20Documentation/Open%20Science%20Catalog%20(OSC)/Discovering%20Resources.md>)
- [ESA Projects Results Repository (PRR)](../Technical%20Documentation/ESA%20Project%20Results%20Repository%20(PRR)/)
- [EarthCODE forum](../Community%20and%20Collaboration/Getting%20Started%20With%20The%20EarthCODE%20Discourse/)

## Authenticated Options

If you wish to add, remove, or update information in the Open Science Catalog, the ESA PRR, or the EarthCODE Forum, you must create an account.

Similarly, an account is required to access the EarthCODE portal and the integrated platform features.

### Creating an Account
You can use a GitHub account to log in to all of these features.

To create a GitHub account, follow the [GitHUB user guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github). Once created, you can use the same account to log in to all EarthCODE features.

### Accessing funcitons

After creating an account and logging in, your next steps depend on the feature you want to use:

- [Open Science Catalog](../Technical%20Documentation/Open%20Science%20Catalog%20(OSC)/Contributing%20to%20the%20Open%20Science%20Catalog.md)
- [ESA PRR](../Technical%20Documentation/ESA%20Project%20Results%20Repository%20(PRR)/Uploading%20To%20PRR.md)
- [EarthCODE Forum](../Community%20and%20Collaboration/Getting%20Started%20With%20The%20EarthCODE%20Discourse/)
- [Integrated Platforms](../Technical%20Documentation/Platforms/)

## EarthCODE workspace
The [EarthCODE workspace](https://workspace.earthcode.eox.at) allows you to access to an integrated Jupyter Lab environment, in order for you to quickly get started with scientific research and experiments. You can also you it to access this documentation page and interactively run all [OSC and PRR examples](https://esa-earthcode.github.io/examples/).

Furthermore, the EarthCODE workspace offers you access to the Open Science Catalog Editor, a user-friendly tool which can be used to add, modify and delete the contents of the Open Science Catalog. It is a convenient helper which abstracts the complexity of working with the file structure of STAC catalogs.

### Accessing the Workspace
As with other EarthCODE features, you must use a GitHub account to log in to the portal.

### Navigating the Workspace

Once you are logged in, you can access all features directly through the portal or find links to them.

When you log in, you will find the navigation bar on the left-hand side, containing links to all available resources and tasks, while the middle pane serves as the main interactive area, changing depending on the option you select.
