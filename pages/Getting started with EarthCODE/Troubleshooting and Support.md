## Frequently Asked Questions
## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use Google Earth Engine (GEE) within EarthCODE?</strong></summary>

Google Earth Engine is not yet one of the integrated EarthCODE platforms, and there are no short‑term plans to add it. You can still process data in GEE and then manually publish the resulting datasets and workflows to EarthCODE. We have logged the community’s interest in a future GEE integration.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I publish pretrained models or anonymised data?</strong></summary>

Yes. The FAIR principles do **not** require assets to be fully open, so you may publish pretrained models or anonymised datasets. Wherever possible, include a small sample dataset to help others reproduce and validate your workflow.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does EarthCODE differ from the GEO Knowledge Hub? Will I need to register my outputs in multiple places?</strong></summary>

EarthCODE is ESA’s default environment for ESA‑funded projects, providing an ecosystem of integrated platforms for developing, executing and sharing open science. Once your data and workflows are FAIR, the same metadata can be exposed to other registries—such as the GEO Knowledge Hub—without duplicating effort.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>When will EarthCODE be released?</strong></summary>

The first set of integrated platforms will be available by **30 June 2025**. Full interoperability between platforms is scheduled for **September 2025**. Additional platforms will be integrated on a rolling basis.

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I integrate a platform with EarthCODE?</strong></summary>

ESA issues “Best‑Practice” procurement tenders periodically. Responding to a tender is the route to integration. Requirements include:

- GitHub‑based single sign‑on  
- Automated publication of data and workflows to the Open Science Catalog  
- Connection to the ESA Project Results Repository for long‑term storage  
- Ability to execute published experiments on the platform  
- Registration in the Network of Resources (NoR) catalogue  
- User documentation and a service‑level agreement (SLA)  

The latest call is described on the [EarthCODE blog](https://earthcode.esa.int/blog/itt-bp2).

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the relationship between EarthCODE and APEx?</strong></summary>

EarthCODE focuses on cataloguing and sharing research outputs. APEx takes mature workflows from EarthCODE and scales them into production‑ready services.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Will EarthCODE make large‑scale Sentinel‑2 processing easier?</strong></summary>

Yes. The integrated platforms provide cloud‑native access to Sentinel‑2 and other large datasets, allowing you to run algorithms where the data reside.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where can I get help integrating my project?</strong></summary>

- Read the platform documentation and training materials.  
- Ask the community in the [EarthCODE Forum](https://discourse-earthcode.eox.at/)—the `#onboarding` category is a good starting point.  
- For personalised assistance, e‑mail **earthcode‑support@esa.int**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Are non‑ESA projects eligible for NoR credits?</strong></summary>

Yes, but priority is given to ESA‑funded projects.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I transfer unused NoR credits between platforms?</strong></summary>

Not yet. Credit transfer is on our roadmap, but is complex because each platform is operated by a different provider.
