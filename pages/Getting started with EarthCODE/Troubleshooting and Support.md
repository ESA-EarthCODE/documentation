## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use Google Earth Engine (GEE) within EarthCODE?</strong></summary>

Google Earth Engine is not yet one of the integrated EarthCODE platforms, and there are no short‚Äëterm plans to add it. You can still process data in GEE and then manually publish the resulting datasets and workflows to EarthCODE. We have logged the community‚Äôs interest in a future GEE integration.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I publish pretrained models or anonymised data?</strong></summary>

Yes. The FAIR principles do **not** require assets to be fully open, so you may publish pretrained models or anonymised datasets. Wherever possible, include a small sample dataset to help others reproduce and validate your workflow.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does EarthCODE differ from the GEO¬†Knowledge¬†Hub? Will I need to register my outputs in multiple places?</strong></summary>

EarthCODE is ESA‚Äôs default environment for ESA‚Äëfunded projects, providing an ecosystem of integrated platforms for developing, executing and sharing open science. Once your data and workflows are FAIR, the same metadata can be exposed to other registries‚Äîsuch as the GEO Knowledge Hub‚Äîwithout duplicating effort.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>When will EarthCODE be released?</strong></summary>

The first set of integrated platforms will be available by **30¬†June¬†2025**. Full interoperability between platforms is scheduled for **September¬†2025**. Additional platforms will be integrated on a rolling basis.

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I integrate a platform with EarthCODE?</strong></summary>

ESA issues ‚ÄúBest‚ÄëPractice‚Äù procurement tenders periodically. Responding to a tender is the route to integration. Requirements include:

- GitHub‚Äëbased single sign‚Äëon  
- Automated publication of data and workflows to the Open Science Catalog  
- Connection to the ESA Project Results Repository for long‚Äëterm storage  
- Ability to execute published experiments on the platform  
- Registration in the Network of Resources (NoR) catalogue  
- User documentation and a service‚Äëlevel agreement (SLA)  

The latest call is described on the [EarthCODE blog](https://earthcode.esa.int/blog/itt-bp2).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the relationship between EarthCODE and APEx?</strong></summary>

EarthCODE focuses on cataloguing and sharing research outputs. APEx takes mature workflows from EarthCODE and scales them into production‚Äëready services.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Will EarthCODE make large‚Äëscale Sentinel‚Äë2 processing easier?</strong></summary>

Yes. The integrated platforms provide cloud‚Äënative access to Sentinel‚Äë2 and other large datasets, allowing you to run algorithms where the data reside.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where can I get help integrating my project?</strong></summary>

- Read the platform documentation and training materials.  
- Ask the community in the [EarthCODE Forum](https://discourse-earthcode.eox.at/)‚Äîthe `#onboarding` category is a good starting point.  
- For personalised assistance, e‚Äëmail **earthcode‚Äësupport@esa.int**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Are non‚ÄëESA projects eligible for NoR credits?</strong></summary>

Yes, but priority is given to ESA‚Äëfunded projects.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I transfer unused NoR credits between platforms?</strong></summary>

Not yet. Credit transfer is on our roadmap, but is complex because each platform is operated by a different provider.

## Issues Regarding EarthCODE Platforms
For these types of issues, the EarthCODE platform providers will directly support you. Please find the relevant types of issues, and their common solutions below. Refer to the [specific platform pages](../Technical%20Documentation/Platforms/) for additional details.

### Datasets
Supported file formats, where and how data are stored, cloud‚Äëbased access, and instructions for preparing and uploading datasets.

### Computational Research
Selecting and accessing compute platforms (DeepESDL, Euro Data Cube, CDSE, etc.), allocation of credits, and others. Executing, reusing or accessing workflows on platforms.


## Issues with ESA Project Results Repository
Typically the platform provider will handle issues related to uploading your results to the ESA PRR if you are using a platform to publish to EarthCODE and you should get in touch with the relevant platform support team.

If however you want to share your work through the ESA PRR and are NOT using a platform, these issues should be addressed with the EarthCODE team. Please use the contact details provided in the [getting help section](./Troubleshooting%20and%20Support.md#getting-help) above.
