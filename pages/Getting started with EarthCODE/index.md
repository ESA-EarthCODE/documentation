# Getting started with EarthCODE


## Welcome!

Welcome to EarthCODE! This page serves as your starting point for exploring the platform. Whether you're a newcomer, a student, an expert, or simply someone interested in using EarthCODE, this guide will help you get started.

Below, you will find a suggested, step-by-step pathway to help you navigate EarthCODE, from basic understanding to more advanced features. Use this guide to familiarize yourself with the platform and stay updated as you engage with the EarthCODE community. You can follow the suggested steps or jump directly to specific sections that interest you:

- [10 minutes to EarthCODE](./10%20minutes%20to%20EarthCODE.md)
- [Deep Dive into EarthCode](./Deep%20Dive%20into%20EarthCODE.md)
- [Connecting External Platforms to EarthCODE](./Connecting%20External%20Platforms%20to%20EarthCODE.md)
- [Troubleshooting and Support](./Troubleshooting%20and%20Support.md)

## Step 1: Understand EarthCODE Terminology

Familiarize yourself with the [key terms and concepts](./key-terms-and-concepts.md) used in EarthCODE. Understanding the terminology will help you navigate the platform and engage with the community effectively.

## Step 2: Explore EarthCODE

Take some time to explore EarthCODE’s core features. This step will help you get familiar with the platform's tools, resources, and how they integrate to support your research.
The best way to follow our tutorials and learn about EarthCODE is by using one of the EarthCODE platforms. We recommend visiting the page where we explain how [to choose the right tools and platforms for your work](../Technical%20Documentation/Working%20With%20Platforms%20and%20Sponsorship/).

### EarthCODE platforms

Visit the [EarthCODE platforms](../Technical%20Documentation/Working%20With%20Platforms%20and%20Sponsorship/) page to learn about the different EarthCODE platforms. There, you will find their respective documentation and instructions on how to access resources.

### Tutorials

This compiled table will take you through the basics of EarthCODE. You can choose any tutorial in a variety of formats: Hands-on and Slides tutorials are more text-based, while Videos and Case studies are more visual-based.

Choose your best fit, experiment, or try them all!
