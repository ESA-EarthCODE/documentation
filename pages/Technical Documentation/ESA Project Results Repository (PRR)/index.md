# ESA Project Results Repository

The [ESA Project Results Repository (PRR)](https://eoresults.esa.int/) provides long term storage for research outcomes. It provides access to data, workflows, experiments and documentation from ESA Projects organised across Collections, accessible via the [STAC API](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec). Each Collection contains [STAC Items](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/item-spec/item-spec.md), with their related Assets stored within the PRR storage. Scientists/commercial companies can access the PRR via the [EarthCODE](https://earthcode.esa.int/) and [APEx](https://esa-apex.github.io/apex_documentation/) projects.
