**Publishing to EarthCODE**  

Publishing to EarthCODE within DeepESDL is possible with `deep-code`.
`deep-code` is a lightweight Python tool for publishing datasets and scientific workflows from DeepESDL 
directly to the EarthCODE open-science-catalog. It provides both a command-line interface (CLI) and a 
Python API for flexible use.

See the [DeepESDL documentation](https://earthsystemdatalab.net/guide/earthcode/) for detailed information.

### Data Access

DeepESDL provides access to a broad range of Earth System datasets through a unified, analysis-ready data 
cube framework with [xcube](https://xcube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataaccess.html#available-data-stores). 

Supported sources include: 

- [Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/)
- [Copernicus Marine Service (CMEMS)](https://marine.copernicus.eu/)
- [Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS)](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/dataset-catalog)
- [DeepESDL Public Data Cubes](https://earthsystemdatalab.net/guide/data/pre-generated/)
- [EOPF Sample Service](https://zarr.eopf.copernicus.eu/)
- [ESA Climate Data Centre (CCI)](https://climate.esa.int/en/data/#/dashboard)
- [ESA SMOS](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/smos)
- [Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI)](https://gedi.umd.edu/)
- [Sentinel Hub](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/)
- [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)](https://stacspec.org/en/about/datasets/)
- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

An expanded overview of supported data sources is provided [here](https://earthsystemdatalab.net/data/).

### Specialised Hardware & Services

CPU, GPU, Dask clusters, MLflow, TensorFlow, [ml4xcube](https://earthsystemdatalab.net/ml-toolkit/),
[geodb](https://xcube-dev.github.io/xcube-geodb/), [xcube Viewer](https://xcube-dev.github.io/xcube-viewer/)

### Visualization Tools

DeepESDL provides several visualization options designed to make multi-dimensional Earth system data cubes
more accessible, moving beyond standard Python plotting libraries.

####  xcube Viewer

DeepESDL integrates the **[xcube Viewer](https://xcube-dev.github.io/xcube-viewer/)**, a web-based tool
for interactive browsing and inspection of data cubes.

* It allows users to navigate data across space, time, and variables.
* The viewer can also be embedded directly in **Jupyter Notebooks**, enabling interactive exploration alongside 
  code and analysis.
* A public deployment at [viewer.earthsystemdatalab.net](https://viewer.earthsystemdatalab.net) provides access 
  to shared datasets without requiring additional setup.
* For more information see the dedicated [documentation](https://xcube-dev.github.io/xcube-viewer/).

#### Lexcube

[**Lexcube**](https://earthsystemdatalab.net/guide/visualisation/lexcube-viewer/) is available both as 
a **Jupyter Notebook integration** and as a **standalone web application**.

* Inside notebooks, it offers lightweight interactive visualization of data layers inline with the workflow.
* As a web app, Lexcube enables direct data cube inspection through a browser interface, useful for sharing results 
  beyond the notebook environment.
* For more information see the [documentation](https://earthsystemdatalab.net/guide/visualisation/lexcube-viewer/).

#### 4D Viewer

The [**4D Viewer**](https://earthsystemdatalab.net/guide/visualisation/4d-viewer/) is a standalone tool for
exploring the full dimensionality of Earth system data, including time and vertical axes.

* The 4D Viewer is suited for comprehensive analysis of highly complex datasets where multiple dimensions need to
  be visualized simultaneously.
* For more information see the [documentation](https://earthsystemdatalab.net/guide/visualisation/4d-viewer/).


DeepESDL also supports dissemination of datasets via public **xcube Viewer applications**, ensuring that published 
data products are accessible and explorable by the wider community.
