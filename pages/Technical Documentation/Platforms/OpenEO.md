# openEO: A Standard for Geospatial Data Processing and Analysis

openEO represents an innovative community standard that revolutionizes geospatial data processing and analysis. This groundbreaking framework provides a novel approach to accessing, processing, and analyzing diverse Earth observation data. By adopting openEO, developers, researchers, and data scientists gain access to a unified and interoperable platform, empowering them to harness distributed computing environments and leverage cloud-based resources for addressing complex geospatial challenges.

## Key Features of openEO

With openEO’s collaborative nature, users can:

- Seamlessly share code, workflows, and data processing methods across platforms and tools.
- Foster collaboration while advancing the accessibility, scalability, and reproducibility of Earth observation data.
- Utilize intuitive programming libraries that simplify the analysis of diverse Earth observation datasets.
- Efficiently access and process large-scale data across multiple infrastructures, supporting:
  - Exploratory research
  - Detailed mapping
  - Information extraction from Earth observation data

This streamlined approach enhances development and empowers the utilization of Earth observation data for various applications and services.

## Open Source Endpoint

The endpoint for the public service is **100% open source** and fully compatible with **Pangeo technology**.
