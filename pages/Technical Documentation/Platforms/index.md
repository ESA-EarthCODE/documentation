# Working with Platforms

This section is your starting point for exploring the platforms and tools available in the EarthCODE ecosystem. Whether you're launching a new project or looking to streamline your existing workflow, you'll find guidance here on how to choose the right platform and make effective use of the **ESA Network of Resources (NoR)** for your research.

To compare platforms at a glance and understand what the NoR can offer, start with [**Choosing Tools and Platforms**](./Choosing%20Tools%20and%20Platforms.md).

For detailed information about each supported platform, including their capabilities and how they can support your specific use case, visit the individual platform pages:
- [**DeepESDL**](DeepESDL.md)
- [**EDC EOxHub**](EOxHub_Pangeo.md)
- [**OpenEO**](./OpenEO.md)
