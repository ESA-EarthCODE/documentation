# Workflows and Experiments

Besides data products, the Open Science Catalog (OSC) also hosts **Workflows**â€”the executable scientific methods used to generate those products. Understanding and reusing these workflows is key to reproducible science in EarthCODE. This page guides you through what workflows are, how to find them in the OSC, and how to access them for your own research.

The [Discovering, Accessing and Reusing Workflows and Experiments Guide](./working-with-workflows) walks you through how you can make use of them for your own science.
