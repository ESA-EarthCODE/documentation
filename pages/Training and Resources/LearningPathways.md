To support learners with different backgrounds and goals, weâ€™ve structured the EarthCODE training offer into three suggested **Learning Pathways**. These pathways guide you through a progression of selected training materialsâ€”from foundational concepts to advanced workflows.

Each pathway draws from the broader collection of [EarthCODE Training materials](https://esa-earthcode.github.io/training-material/) and recommended external training materials introduced above. They provide a curated path for skill development, while still allowing you to jump across levels based on your interests and experience.

## ðŸŸ¢ Start Simple

For new users and those unfamiliar with Earth observation or cloud-based environments.

**Key goals:**
- Get comfortable with the EarthCODE platforms and learn how to choose the one that best suits your research needs
- Understand what the Network of Resources (NoR) offers and how to apply for access or sponsorship
- Learn how to access and explore data from the EarthCODE Science Catalog

**Recommended modules:**
- *Getting Started with EarthCODE platforms*  
- *Introduction to NoR Services*  
- *Cubes and Clouds: Intermediate Use of EO Data Cubes*  
- *Exploring and reusing data from the ESA Open Science Catalog*  

## ðŸŸ¡ Grow Your Skills

For users with basic experience who are ready to take on more collaborative and technical workflows.

**Key goals:**
- Prepare your datasets and publish them to EarthCODE
- Develop, reuse, and publish workflows to EarthCODE

**Recommended modules:**
- *Publishing Outputs via EarthCODE*  
- *Reusing and Sharing data and Workflows*  

## ðŸ”µ Excel with EarthCODE

For advanced users aiming to master the environment, automate workflows, or contribute to the ecosystem.

**Key goals:**
- End-to-end workflow 
- Automate workflows
- Contribute back to the EarthCODE community

**Recommended modules:**
- *Advanced Workflow Optimization in Jupyter*  
- *Building Community-Contributed Workflows*  


These pathways are suggestionsâ€”you can move freely between them based on your project needs or curiosity. Explore the full list of training resources in the [EarthCODE Training Portal](https://esa-earthcode.github.io/training-material/) to find more tutorials, notebooks, and guides.
