# Tutorials and Learning Pathways

In this section, we highlight tutorials, learning pathways, and resources designed to help you progressively build the skills needed to master EarthCODE capabilities.

## Starting Point

The fastest way to gain value from EarthCODE is to first become familiar with its core capabilities by following the [Getting Started with EarthCODE guide](../Getting%20started%20with%20EarthCODE/). Once you understand your role and what EarthCODE can offer, you can explore the relevant guide or go directly to the [Examples Bank](https://esa-earthcode.github.io/tutorials/). Finding an example that closely matches your data, workflow, or problem is often the best starting point, as most examples are drawn from real-world projects.

At any point during this process, you can engage in the forum and ask for help. If you are using a platform, you can also contact them directly.

## Next Steps


After learning the basics, you can explore EarthCODE in greater depth. This includes reviewing the [Best Practices guide](../Community%20and%20Best%20Practices/) and gaining a thorough understanding of the FAIR principles. Based on what you learn from the guide and your use case, you may want to update your data or workflows to align more closely to FAIR principles.

At this stage, you can also explore other existing projects to learn from their approaches. In addition, you can examine more advanced examples to discover how others are applying EarthCODE capabilities.

Furthermore, you can explore the following advanced materials:

## Recommended Materials and Training

### Courses

- **[Cubes & Clouds](https://eo-college.org/courses/cubes-and-clouds/)**: A course focused on data cubes, cloud computing, and open science in Earth observation. This aligns well with EarthCODEâ€™s mission to promote open access to scientific data.

- **External Platforms and Tools**: We also recommend exploring platforms such as the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) and Euro Data Cube (EDC), which provide additional learning materials that integrate with EarthCODE.

### Examples

The [Examples Bank](https://esa-earthcode.github.io/tutorials/) will show you how to carry out a variety of tasks. All examples are based on actual use cases from other ESA projects and demonstrate how they are using EarthCODE. Currently, the focus is on publishing to the Open Science Catalog and uploading data to the ESA PRR, but the examples are continuously expanding.

All examples are runnable directly through the [EarthCODE workspace](https://workspace.earthcode.eox.at).

### Documentation

You can use the documentation provided on this website to learn more about EarthCODE. For deeper insight into the technical aspects of the project, visit the GitHub repositories of the underlying components, such as the [OSC Technical Design](https://github.com/ESA-EarthCODE/open-science-catalog-metadata/wiki/System-Design-Document-%E2%80%90-v1.0.0).

### Training, News, and Updates

For the latest news on upcoming training events and to access past session recordings, visit the **EarthCODE News and Updates** section on our [EarthCODE website](https://earthcode.esa.int/#latest-news-updates) and the [Community Engagement section on the forum](https://discourse-earthcode.eox.at/c/community-engagement/11).

You can request custom training through the NoR page by contacting the platform providers directly.
