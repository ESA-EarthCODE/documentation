#  10 minutes to EarthCODE

Welcome to 10 Minutes to EarthCODE! This quick-start guide is designed to help you set up your environment and begin working with EarthCODE in just a few minutes. Whether you're new to Earth Science, a researcher, or a developer, EarthCODE provides a collaborative, open development environment for efficient access to Earth observation data, workflows, and computational platforms.

## What is EarthCODE?
EarthCODE stands for "Earth Science Collaborative Open Development Environment." It enables seamless interaction with various data platforms, each providing access to different Earth Science datasets. EarthCODE integrates the following platforms to facilitate your research:

- Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE)
- Deep Earth System Data Laboratory (DeepESDL)
- Euro Data Cube
- EoxHub/Colcalc
- EoxHub/Pangeo
T
hese platforms offer diverse datasets, tools, and services, helping you find the right data for your research. Access to these platforms is enabled via single sign-on through openID Connect, ensuring a smooth authentication process across resources requiring access credentials.

## Accessing EarthCODE
To get started, sign in using openID Connect, which provides secure authentication for accessing resources on different platforms. Once authenticated, you'll have access to all the tools and data you need across EarthCODE’s integrated platforms.

## Choosing a Platform
EarthCODE connects you to multiple platforms, each catering to different Earth Science needs:

- Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) – A gateway for Copernicus data and services.
- Deep Earth System Data Laboratory (DeepESDL) – A comprehensive resource for geophysical data and modeling.
- Euro Data Cube – A platform focused on satellite data storage and analysis.
- EoxHub/Colcalc – A cloud-based processing system for Earth observation data.
- EoxHub/Pangeo – A powerful environment for high-performance computation of Earth Science data.

Consider your research needs when selecting the platform that best aligns with your work.

## Exploring the EarthCODE Science Catalog

After selecting your platform, you can explore the EarthCODE Science Catalog. The catalog includes datasets, workflows, and software that have been published and validated within EarthCODE. It's your gateway to a wide range of resources, whether you're looking for environmental data, code for processing, or reusable workflows.

## Validating and Publishing Data

EarthCODE allows you to validate products and experiments, ensuring they meet reproducibility and scientific standards. If you have an ESA-funded project, you can contribute to the platform by publishing your datasets, software, or experiments, making your work available for the broader community to use.

## Who Can Publish?

Anyone with an ESA-funded project is encouraged to publish in EarthCODE. We especially welcome contributions from those part of the ESA Science Clusters, as collaboration among these projects helps promote sharing and innovation in Earth Science research.
