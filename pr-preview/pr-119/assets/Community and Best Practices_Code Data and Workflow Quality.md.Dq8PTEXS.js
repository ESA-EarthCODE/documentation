Below are tips and recommended practices to support quality assurance and reproducibility:</p><ul><li>Code Quality <ul><li>Use Version Control: Track your development using Git and a shared repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab).</li><li>Automate Testing: Implement unit tests and integration tests using tools like pytest, unittest, or CI/CD workflows.</li><li>Follow Coding Standards: Adopt a consistent style (e.g., PEP8 for Python) and use linters (e.g., flake8, black) to maintain code clarity.</li><li>Write Documentation: Provide clear usage instructions and inline comments. Consider using Jupyter Notebooks or Markdown README files to explain workflows.</li></ul></li><li>Data Quality <ul><li>Validate Your Data: Apply automated checks for data formats, missing values, and schema consistency.</li><li>Document Your Data: Create or maintain metadata alongside your datasets, including descriptions of variables, units, and collection methods.</li><li>Use Standard Formats: Choose interoperable, machine-readable formats (e.g., NetCDF, GeoTIFF, Zarr) and community-agreed standards (such as CF-Conventions).</li><li>Track Data Changes: when needed, version datasets as they evolve and log processing steps to support reproducibility.</li></ul></li><li>Integration with EarthCODE <ul><li>Use EarthCODE-Compatible Tools: When possible, rely on tools and environments that are natively supported within EarthCODE platforms.</li><li>Test Workflows in EarthCODE Early: Validate your workflows in the target platform before final publication to avoid integration issues.</li><li>Publish Intermediate Outputs: Store and document intermediate results to help others understand and reuse your work incrementally.</li><li>Regularly revisiting these practices during the project lifecycle will reduce last-minute issues and make your results easier to share and build upon.</li></ul></li></ul>',8)]))}const m=e(o,[["render",n]]);export{h as __pageData,m as default};
