At the heart of this transformation is the convergence of <strong>FAIR principles</strong> (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) and Open Science - which create unprecedented opportunities for scalable, cross-sector research and decision-making.</p><p>ESA&#39;s strategic objective is to <strong>foster the development of a culture and practice of openness in EO science, applications and industry, and of a sustainable open innovation ecosystem</strong>.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="Open Science"></p><p>Adopting FAIR principles at scale for data and workflows in Earth Observation is essential for implementing this vision as it enables scientists to (1) Access and process satellite and in-situ data (in collaborative cloud environments such as EarthCODE Platforms), (2) Develop and publish reusable code and workflows, (3) Validate outputs and share reproducible results, and (4) Collaborate across institutional, disciplinary, and national boundaries. Openness enhances transparency and trust in research results, facilitates collaboration between different institutions and disciplines, and significantly reduces duplication of efforts.</p><p>Moreover, FAIR and Open Science practices improve data quality and longevity, allowing researchers to build upon existing knowledge and to more effectively address complex global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and sustainable development.</p><p>Adopting FAIR and Open Science practices also provides direct personal benefits to researchers. It enhances the visibility and citation of their work, fosters potential new collaborations, and expands professional networks. Moreover, by making research outputs clearly documented and easily accessible, researchers save time in their daily workflows, simplify data management tasks, and improve their ability to build upon prior work—including their own.</p><h2 id="open-science-a-collaborative-and-transparent-approach" tabindex="-1">Open Science: A Collaborative and Transparent Approach <a class="header-anchor" href="#open-science-a-collaborative-and-transparent-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Open Science: A Collaborative and Transparent Approach&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Open Science is a movement that promotes transparency, accessibility, and collaboration in scientific research.

It’s essential to define roles and access levels early on to streamline collaboration and ensure data security. PIs should encourage their teams to adopt consistent metadata practices and use standardized data formats, ensuring that datasets are properly organized, discoverable, and accessible throughout the project. Choosing appropriate licenses early in the project is also crucial to avoid any legal or access issues later on. PIs must actively show support for the adoption of Open Science practices, fostering an environment that encourages transparency, collaboration, and data sharing. By promoting these practices, PIs help create a culture of openness that facilitates seamless integration of data and enhances the research process. Regularly reviewing and adjusting workflows will help maintain alignment with project goals and data management best practices.</p><h2 id="from-fair-principles-to-fair-in-practice" tabindex="-1">From FAIR Principles to FAIR in Practice <a class="header-anchor" href="#from-fair-principles-to-fair-in-practice" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;From FAIR Principles to FAIR in Practice&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="a-conceptual-overview-of-fair-principles" tabindex="-1">A Conceptual Overview of FAIR Principles <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-conceptual-overview-of-fair-principles" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A Conceptual Overview of FAIR Principles&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) provide a structured approach to managing data, ensuring that both data and processing workflows can be efficiently discovered, accessed, and used across disciplines. Given the increasing volume and complexity of Earth Observation (EO) data—ranging from satellite imagery to in situ measurements—FAIR principles are essential for enabling automated discovery, seamless integration, and reproducible science.</p><p>FAIR is not just about data; <strong>software</strong>, <strong>models</strong>, and <strong>workflows</strong> must also be FAIR to ensure full reproducibility of scientific analyses. This requires:</p><ul><li><strong>FAIR metadata</strong> for software and workflows, ensuring clear documentation of inputs, outputs, dependencies, and provenance.</li><li><strong>Persistent identifiers (PIDs)</strong> for datasets, algorithms, and workflows to support traceability and reuse.</li><li><strong>Interoperable formats and standards</strong>, such as netCDF, Zarr, and STAC for data, or CWL (Common Workflow Language) for workflow portability, OGC API - Processes for standardized execution, and openEO for cloud-based EO data processing, ensuring compatibility across platforms.</li><li><strong>Accessible computing environments</strong>, such as the <a href="https://nor-discover.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">cloud-based processing platforms available in EarthCODE</a>, which allow users to execute EO workflows.</li></ul><p><strong>FAIR does not imply that data or software must be open</strong> by default, but rather that they are well-described, structured, and reusable under appropriate conditions.
