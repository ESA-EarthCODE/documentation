The STAC Collection provides metadata about your files and makes them searchable and machine readable. The metadata generation process is organised in four steps process:</p><ol><li>Generate a root STAC Collection</li><li>Group your dataset files into STAC Items and STAC Assets</li><li>Add the Items to the Collection</li><li>Save the normalised Collection</li><li>Send the data, metadata and some extra information to the EarthCODE team.</li></ol><p><strong>In the examples you will find guides to the whole process, code samples from other ESA projects, as well as instructions how to access data from and traverse the PRR</strong>. We recomend starting with the introductory notebook.</p><ul><li><a href="https://esa-earthcode.github.io/examples/index-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PRR Examples</a></li></ul>',5)]))}const u=t(i,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,u as default};
