You can still process data in GEE and then manually publish the resulting datasets and workflows to EarthCODE. We have logged the community‚Äôs interest in a future GEE integration.</p></details><details><summary><strong>Can I publish pre-trained models or anonymized data?</strong></summary><p>Yes. The FAIR principles do <strong>not</strong> require assets to be fully open, so you may publish pre-trained models or anonymized datasets. Wherever possible, include a small sample dataset to help others reproduce and validate your workflow.</p></details><details><summary><strong>How does EarthCODE differ from the GEO¬†Knowledge¬†Hub? Will I need to register my outputs in multiple places?</strong></summary><p>EarthCODE is ESA‚Äôs default environment for ESA‚Äëfunded projects, providing an ecosystem of integrated platforms for developing, executing and sharing open science. Once your data and workflows are FAIR, the same metadata can be exposed to other registries‚Äîsuch as the GEO Knowledge Hub‚Äîwithout duplicating effort.</p></details><details><summary><strong>When will EarthCODE be released?</strong></summary><p>The first set of integrated platforms will be available by <strong>30¬†June¬†2025</strong>. Full interoperability between platforms is scheduled for <strong>September¬†2025</strong>. Additional platforms will be integrated on a rolling basis.</p><p><em>Stay informed:</em></p><ul><li><a href="https://earthcode.esa.int/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EarthCODE website</a></li><li><a href="https://discourse-earthcode.eox.at/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Forum</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/106663043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://esacontact.esa.int/ESA_EO_OpenScience_Subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Newsletter</a></li></ul></details><details><summary><strong>How do I integrate a platform with EarthCODE?</strong></summary><p>ESA issues ‚ÄúBest‚ÄëPractice‚Äù procurement tenders periodically.

APEx takes mature workflows from EarthCODE and scales them into production‚Äëready services.</p></details><details><summary><strong>Will EarthCODE make large‚Äëscale Sentinel‚Äë2 processing easier?</strong></summary><p>Yes. The integrated platforms provide cloud‚Äënative access to Sentinel‚Äë2 and other large datasets, allowing you to run algorithms where the data reside.</p></details><details><summary><strong>Where can I get help integrating my project?</strong></summary><ul><li>Read the platform documentation and training materials.</li><li>Ask the community in the <a href="https://discourse-earthcode.eox.at/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EarthCODE Forum</a>‚Äîthe <code>#onboarding</code> category is a good starting point.</li><li>For personalised assistance, e‚Äëmail <strong>earthcode‚Äësupport@esa.int</strong>.</li></ul></details><details><summary><strong>Are non‚ÄëESA projects eligible for NoR credits?</strong></summary><p>Yes, but priority is given to ESA‚Äëfunded projects.</p></details><details><summary><strong>Can I transfer unused NoR credits between platforms?</strong></summary><p>Not yet. Credit transfer is on our roadmap, but is complex because each platform is operated by a different provider.</p></details><h2 id="common-issues-and-solutions" tabindex="-1">Common Issues and Solutions <a class="header-anchor" href="#common-issues-and-solutions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Common Issues and Solutions&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>A list of common problems users might encounter and how to resolve them.</p><h2 id="issues-regarding-earthcode" tabindex="-1">Issues Regarding EarthCODE <a class="header-anchor" href="#issues-regarding-earthcode" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Issues Regarding EarthCODE&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>For these types of issues, the EarthCODE project team will directly support you.
