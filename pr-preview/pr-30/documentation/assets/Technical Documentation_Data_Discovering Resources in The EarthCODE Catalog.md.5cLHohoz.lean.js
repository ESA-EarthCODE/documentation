These resources vary in geographical and temporal extent, production methodology, validation, and quality, supporting a wide range of scientific applications. The OSC supports data discovery, access, and integration, promoting Open Science principles.</p><h3 id="accessing-the-open-science-catalog" tabindex="-1">Accessing the Open Science Catalog <a class="header-anchor" href="#accessing-the-open-science-catalog" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Accessing the Open Science Catalog&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>You can explore the Open Science Catalog from any web browser by navigating to:</p><p>ðŸ‘‰ <a href="https://opensciencedata.esa.int/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://opensciencedata.esa.int/</a></p><p>Upon entering the portal, you will see a welcome page that introduces the catalog and its functionalities. The catalog organizes resources into six thematic research domains, allowing users to easily browse and discover relevant projects, products, workflows, and experiments.</p><p>From the landing page, you can also access:</p><ul><li>Search tools for locating products</li><li>Catalog to browse available products</li><li>Metrics to explore data availability statistics</li><li>API capabilities for programmatic access</li></ul><p><img src="https://github.com/EOEPCA/open-science-catalog-metadata/assets/120453810/a97e40c1-0f69-4204-9aef-95030c5a8455" alt="OSC-main-page"></p><h3 id="the-open-science-catalog-landing-page" tabindex="-1">The Open Science Catalog Landing Page <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-open-science-catalog-landing-page" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Open Science Catalog Landing Page&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>The OSC front-end serves as the primary user interface, enabling scientists and other users to interact with the system and access its contents.

This catalog consists of inter-linked JSON files (Collections and Items) along with supplementary metadata. The catalog facilitates the discovery of the following elements:</p><ul><li>Themes</li><li>Variables</li><li>EO-Missions</li><li>Projects</li><li>Products</li><li>Workflows</li><li>Experiments</li></ul><p>Each element lists number of objects of selected type, which are in turn represented as a STAC Catalog or STAC Collection. These objects use the OSC STAC extension to reference elements of other groups they are associated with. e.g a Product has an &quot;osc:variables&quot; field, that lists the measurement variables this product is comprised of.

It facilitates data and knowledge integration and reuse by the scientific community. With common dictionary and unified metadata across heterogeneous sources, products discovery is facilitated. Published Products are associated to Project and additional information is provided by tags. Themes and variables are used as tag to facilitate products discovery. Earth Observation Satellite Missions used to generate the product is provided by EO-Mission description in Product&#39;s metadata.</p><p><strong>THEMES</strong>: one of the Earth Science topics linked to the grand science challenges set in the ESA strategy.</p><p><strong>PROJECT</strong>: scientific research projects funded by ESA EOâ€‹</p><p><strong>PRODUCT</strong>: a geoscience product representing the measured or inferred/estimated values of one or more variables over a given time range and spatial area.

The OSC Metrics Page provides an overview of the available geospatial products, aggregated by one of selected elements: Variables (default), Themes, Projects, EO Missions. Temporal and spatial coverage of products aggregated under selected category (element) is displayed. <img src="https://github.com/EOEPCA/open-science-catalog-metadata/assets/120453810/25264857-1c89-45fa-b048-17d64b845968" alt="metrics-1"></p><p>The slider below the metrics window: <img src="https://github.com/EOEPCA/open-science-catalog-metadata/assets/120453810/c0cb1e4f-3440-44e1-a7fb-af0fa1264218" alt="slider"> allows zoom in and out the display of table containing the metrics.</p><p>Products can also be filtered out using a Filter box above the metrics table. The Filter works in the same way as Search, meaning that the product list can be narrowed down by filtering by free typing or by selecting given type of content (by selecting particular Theme, Variable, Project, Product, EO Mission, Geometry: by area of interest indicated on the interactive map or Free text filter).</p><p>Once selected, filter name and selected value appears in the text box to facilitate the user removal of selected filter and remembering of different filters applied.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/EOEPCA/open-science-catalog-metadata/assets/120453810/d42070bb-999a-4d23-8011-1cfe35f987e5" alt="metrics-2"></p><p>The filter takes also free text as an input, so any word typed in the filter field will be taken to search through the variable names but also their acronyms, product names and description field. Therefore, it is also possible to use keywords if the exact variable or product name of an item is not known. For example, the term <em>&quot;carbon&quot;</em> will return the list of following variables and products <em>(Carbon Flux, Carbonate, Microphytoplankton Carbon etc.)</em>. <img src="https://github.com/EOEPCA/open-science-catalog-metadata/assets/120453810/8dbed4f4-e41c-4fc2-808c-040b8ca3d23f" alt="metrics-3"></p><p>The last column in that page provides details about spatial coverage of selected product.
