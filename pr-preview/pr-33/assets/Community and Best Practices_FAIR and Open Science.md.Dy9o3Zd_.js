Given the increasing volume and complexity of Earth Observation (EO) data—ranging from satellite imagery to in situ measurements—FAIR principles are essential for enabling automated discovery, seamless integration, and reproducible science.</p><p>FAIR is not just about data; <strong>software</strong>, <strong>models</strong>, and <strong>workflows</strong> must also be FAIR to ensure full reproducibility of scientific analyses. This requires:</p><ul><li><strong>FAIR metadata</strong> for software and workflows, ensuring clear documentation of inputs, outputs, dependencies, and provenance.</li><li><strong>Persistent identifiers (PIDs)</strong> for datasets, algorithms, and workflows to support traceability and reuse.</li><li><strong>Interoperable formats and standards</strong>, such as netCDF, Zarr, and STAC for data, or CWL (Common Workflow Language) for workflow portability, OGC API - Processes for standardized execution, and openEO for cloud-based EO data processing, ensuring compatibility across platforms.</li><li><strong>Accessible computing environments</strong>, such as the <a href="https://esa-earthcode.github.io/documentation/Technical%20Documentation/Working%20With%20Platforms%20and%20Sponsorship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">cloud-based processing platforms available in EarthCODE</a>, which allow users to execute EO workflows.</li></ul><p><strong>FAIR does not imply that data or software must be open</strong> by default, but rather that they are well-described, structured, and reusable under appropriate conditions. By applying FAIR principles to both data and processing, the EO community can enhance scientific transparency, improve cross-disciplinary collaboration, and enable scalable, automated analysis—key for addressing global challenges like climate change, disaster response, and biodiversity conservation.</p><h3 id="a-deep-dive-into-the-fair-principles" tabindex="-1">A Deep Dive into the FAIR Principles <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-deep-dive-into-the-fair-principles" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A Deep Dive into the FAIR Principles&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Everyone knows F, A, I, and R, but the FAIR Guiding Principles consist of 15 one-liners that define the key behaviors necessary for making data and services machine-actionable.
