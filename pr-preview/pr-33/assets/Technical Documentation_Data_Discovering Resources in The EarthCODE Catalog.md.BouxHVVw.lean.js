It is a publicly available platform that provides access to datasets, products, and scientific resources developed under ESA-funded Earth Observation (EO) research projects. These products vary in geographical and temporal extent, production methodology, validation, and quality, supporting a wide range of scientific applications.</p><p>This section explains the functionality of the Open Science Data Catalogue, detailing how researchers can explore, access, and utilize geoscience products and datasets stored within the platform.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/EOEPCA/open-science-catalog-metadata/assets/120453810/9f3ae080-47fd-494b-bceb-ba9db48f0799" alt="OSC-main"></p><p>The majority of pages on <em><a href="https://opensciencedata.esa.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://opensciencedata.esa.int</a></em> only hold metadata for each Product and Project. The actual data and its documentation are maintained and accessible by the data providers, outside of esa.int, for the majority of cases. This catalogue provides the metadata and links to the data as it exists in those many other locations.</p><p>Open Science Data Catalogue is free to use by any user with an access to Internet. Contributing to catalogue (ingesting new products or updating existing) is reserved to authorized users only (project PIs, data owners).</p><p><strong>What are the capabilities of the Open Science Data Catalogue?</strong></p><p>Open Science Catalog is not only a project&#39;s metadata browser.

This catalog consists of inter-linked JSON files (Collections and Items) along with supplementary metadata. The catalog facilitates the discovery of the following elements:</p><ul><li>Themes</li><li>Variables</li><li>EO-Missions</li><li>Projects</li><li>Products</li><li>Processes</li></ul><p>Each element lists number of objects of selected type, which are in turn represented as a STAC Catalogue or STAC Collection. These objects use the OSC STAC extension to reference elements of other groups they are associated with. e.g a Product has an &quot;osc:variables&quot; field, that lists the measurement variables this product is comprised of.

It facilitates data and knowledge integration and reuse by the scientific community. With common dictionary and unified metadata across heterogeneous sources, products discovery is facilitated. Published Products are associated to Project and additional information is provided by tags. Themes and variables are used as tag to facilitate products discovery. Earth Observation Satellite Missions used to generate the product is provided by EO-Mission description in Product&#39;s metadata.</p><p><strong>THEMES</strong>: one of the Earth Science topics linked to the grand science challenges set in the ESA strategy.</p><p><strong>PROJECT</strong>: scientific research projects funded by ESA EOâ€‹</p><p><strong>PRODUCT</strong>: a geoscience product representing the measured or inferred/estimated values of one or more variables over a given time range and spatial area.

The OSC Metrics Page provides an overview of the available geospatial products, aggregated by one of selected elements: Variables (default), Themes, Projects, EO Missions. Temporal and spatial coverage of products aggregated under selected category (element) is displayed. <img src="https://github.com/EOEPCA/open-science-catalog-metadata/assets/120453810/25264857-1c89-45fa-b048-17d64b845968" alt="metrics-1"></p><p>The slider below the metrics window: <img src="https://github.com/EOEPCA/open-science-catalog-metadata/assets/120453810/c0cb1e4f-3440-44e1-a7fb-af0fa1264218" alt="slider"> allows zoom in and out the display of table containing the metrics.</p><p>Products can also be filtered out using a Filter box above the metrics table. The Filter works in the same way as Search, meaning that the product list can be narrowed down by filtering by free typing or by selecting given type of content (by selecting particular Theme, Variable, Project, Product, EO Mission, Geometry: by area of interest indicated on the interactive map or Free text filter).</p><p>Once selected, filter name and selected value appears in the text box to facilitate the user removal of selected filter and remembering of different filters applied.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/EOEPCA/open-science-catalog-metadata/assets/120453810/d42070bb-999a-4d23-8011-1cfe35f987e5" alt="metrics-2"></p><p>The filter takes also free text as an input, so any word typed in the filter field will be taken to search through the variable names but also their acronyms, product names and description field. Therefore, it is also possible to use keywords if the exact variable or product name of an item is not known. For example, the term <em>&quot;carbon&quot;</em> will return the list of following variables and products <em>(Carbon Flux, Carbonate, Microphytoplankton Carbon etc.)</em>. <img src="https://github.com/EOEPCA/open-science-catalog-metadata/assets/120453810/8dbed4f4-e41c-4fc2-808c-040b8ca3d23f" alt="metrics-3"></p><p>The last column in that page provides details about spatial coverage of selected product.
