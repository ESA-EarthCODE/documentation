Whether you&#39;re launching a new project or looking to streamline your existing workflow, you&#39;ll find guidance here on how to choose the right platform and their key capabilities.</p><p>Here provide only the information that the platforms can be self-sponsored (for those who have already access to them) or can be requested by ESA NOR portal (provide a link and the link to tutorial, for those new to NoR)</p><p>The EarthCODE integrated platforms can either be self-sponsored if your team already have access to them. You can alternatively apply for sponsorship from the <a href="https://nor-discover.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Network of Resources</a> for access &amp; resources on your selected platform. Please refer to the <a href="./../../Training and Resources/NoR">NoR Tutorial Page</a> for more details about making a NoR application.</p><hr><h2 id="choosing-tools-and-platforms" tabindex="-1">Choosing Tools and Platforms <a class="header-anchor" href="#choosing-tools-and-platforms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Choosing Tools and Platforms&quot;">​</a></h2><p>EarthCODE provides you <em>single‑sign‑on</em> access to a growing number of EO platforms that host EO data, development tools and compute. Once you log in with your EarthCODE account, you carry the same identity across the <strong>EarthCODE Portal</strong>, the <strong>EarthCODE Forum</strong>, each <strong>integrated platform</strong>, and the <strong>Open Science Catalog</strong>.</p><p>For all of the EarthCODE integrated platforms, you can apply for Network‑of‑Resources (NoR) sponsorship to cover compute costs. Every platform comes with FAIR tooling that lets you publish results to the Open Science Catalog in an automated manner. Additionally, some platforms support creating and executing several types of workflows, which means that if you develop a workflow on them, it will be cross-compatible with other platforms.</p><p><img src="'+e+'" alt="EarthCODE Platform"></p><p>Platforms differ in four areas: the data they give you access to (and the way you access the data), the way you develop workflows on them, specialized hardware and infrastructure they offer, and the visualisation tools they offer. See <a href="./../../Getting started with EarthCODE/10 minutes to EarthCODE">10 Minutes to EarthCODE</a> for some examples of platform featues. Additionally, different platforms support different sized options for computing resources and different languages.
