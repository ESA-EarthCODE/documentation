These resources vary in geographical and temporal extent, production methodology, validation, and quality, supporting a wide range of scientific applications. The OSC supports data discovery, access, and integration, promoting Open Science principles.</p><h3 id="accessing-the-open-science-catalog" tabindex="-1">Accessing the Open Science Catalog <a class="header-anchor" href="#accessing-the-open-science-catalog" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Accessing the Open Science Catalog&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>You can explore the Open Science Catalog from any web browser by navigating to:</p><p>ðŸ‘‰ <a href="https://opensciencedata.esa.int/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://opensciencedata.esa.int/</a></p><p>Upon entering the portal, you will see a welcome page that introduces the catalog and its functionalities.

It facilitates data and knowledge integration and reuse by the scientific community. With common dictionary and unified metadata across heterogeneous sources, products discovery is facilitated. Published Products are associated to Projects and additional information is provided by tags. Themes and Variables are used as tags to facilitate Products discovery. Earth Observation Satellite Missions used to generate the Product are provided by EO-Mission description in Product&#39;s metadata.</p><p><strong>Themes</strong>: One of the Earth Science topics linked to the grand science challenges set in the ESA strategy.</p><p><strong>Project</strong>: Scientific research projects funded by ESA EO.</p><p><strong>Product</strong>: A geoscience product representing the measured or inferred/estimated values of one or more variables over a given time range and spatial area. Products can be distinguished by geographical and temporal extent, production methodology, validation, quality, and EO Mission/sensor used to produce them.</p><p><strong>Variables</strong>: Geoscience, climate, and environmental variable. Variables are represented in the hierarchical set of Earth Science variables based on the NASA GCMD keywords convention.</p><p><strong>Keywords</strong>: Keywords are used to facilitate Product discovery.

Once selected, the filter is shown in the text box allowing to remove it and showing the currently applied filters.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/EOEPCA/open-science-catalog-metadata/assets/120453810/d42070bb-999a-4d23-8011-1cfe35f987e5" alt="metrics-2"></p><p>The filter takes also free text as an input. Thus, any string typed in the filter field will be taken to search through the variable names but also their acronyms, product names, and description fields. Therefore, it is also possible to use keywords if the exact variable or product name of an item is not known. For example, the term <em>&quot;carbon&quot;</em> will return the list of following variables and products <em>(Carbon Flux, Carbonate, Microphytoplankton Carbon, etc.)</em>.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/EOEPCA/open-science-catalog-metadata/assets/120453810/8dbed4f4-e41c-4fc2-808c-040b8ca3d23f" alt="metrics-3"></p><p>The last column in that page provides details about the spatial coverage of selected products.
