This is why it is important to consider what tooling/platforms one uses so as to ensure reuse-ability from the start of the project.</p></div><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="EarthCODE Components"></p><p>The <strong>EarthCODE Portal</strong> (<a href="https://earthcode.esa.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">earthcode.esa.int</a>), is where users access all EarthCODE services. Through this portal, researchers can explore integrated platforms, access the Open Science Catalog, and engage with peers via the Discourse community forum. The portal also hosts general information about EarthCODE, including updates, events, and documentation.</p><p>EarthCODE provides access to a set of <strong>integrated EO cloud platforms</strong>, each offering unique tools and datasets. As an EarthCODE integrated platform they provide common capabilities: logging in with your EarthCODE account, accessing EO data (with variations in data offerings across platforms), a method for developing algorithms (referred to as <strong>workflows</strong> in EarthCODE), an automated way of publishing data and workflows to the Open Science Catalog and finally, the means of running EarthCODE published experiments. Access to computing resources and storage on these platforms is sponsored by ESA through the <a href="https://nor-discover.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Network of Resources (NoR)</a>.</p><p>For those who prefer to work on their own systems—whether personal computers or institutional infrastructure—EarthCODE also supports manual publishing of data and workflows.</p><p>When your research is complete, you:</p><ul><li>(Optionally) Upload <strong>your datasets and workflows</strong> to the <strong>ESA Project Results Repository (PRR)</strong>.</li><li>Create and upload <strong>metadata describing your results</strong> to the <strong>Open Science Catalog</strong>, which link to your data.</li></ul><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title"><em>Only ESA-funded projects can publish to EarthCODE.</em></p></div><p>The <strong>ESA Project Results Repository (ESA PRR)</strong> is a long-term storage service provided by ESA to persistently host results from ESA-funded projects. Once users have completed their work, they can upload their datasets and workflows to the PRR to ensure they remain accessible and preserved over time. While publishing to the PRR is optional, it is strongly recommended for long-term availability and compliance with FAIR principles. A detailed guide to this process is available in the <a href="./../Technical Documentation/Data/Contributing to the EarthCODE Catalog">publication section</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://opensciencedata.esa.int/catalog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Open Science Catalog (OSC)</strong></a> is a public, web-based application that allows users to explore and access scientific datasets, workflows, and documentation produced through ESA-funded Earth Observation research. Researchers publish metadata describing their outputs to the Open Science Catalog, and after review, this metadata is made discoverable through the OSC. The catalog uses STAC to describe datasets and OGC API - Records for workflows. Through this rich metadata on the Open Science Catalog, resources are made FAIR. Additionally, the open science catalog is integrated with the EarthCODE platforms and allows users to reproduce experiments (run workflows that produce products) that they find on the catalog.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">The Open Science Catalog only holds the metadata which points to the persistent storage repository with your dataset.</p></div><p>The <a href="https://discourse-earthcode.eox.at" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>EarthCODE Forum</strong></a> is a <strong>community space</strong> where users:</p><ul><li>Share insights and questions about datasets and workflows</li><li>Link forum discussions directly to catalog entries</li><li>Get help from the EarthCODE team and community</li></ul><p>Each published item in the OSC can be linked to a discussion thread, enabling exposure and ongoing discussions about outputs.</p><hr><h2 id="step-2-explore-earthcode" tabindex="-1">Step 2: Explore EarthCODE <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-2-explore-earthcode" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Step 2: Explore EarthCODE&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This step will help you become familiar with the platform&#39;s tools and resources, and how they integrate to support your research.

It further serves as a place for developers and users to contribute workflows, platforms and discover openly available Earth Science research data and code. There are two key type of roles within EarthCODE:</p><p><strong>Scientists</strong>, EarthCODE is a platform to: Do science. Publish science. Discover data and code. Use other people’s data and code in an ethical manner. Discuss science. Collaborate on science. Learn about FAIR and Open Science.</p><p><strong>Developers</strong>, EarthCODE is a space to: Expand the open-source ecosystem. Contribute tools and workflows.
